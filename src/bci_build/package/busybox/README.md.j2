# SLE BCI-BusyBox: When you need the smallest and GPLv3-free image

Similar to SLE BCI-Micro, the SLE BCI-BusyBox image comes with the most
basic tools only. However, these tools are provided by the BusyBox
project. This has the benefit of further size reduction. Furthermore,
the image contains no GPLv3 licensed software. When using the image,
keep in mind that there are certain differences between the BusyBox
tools and the GNU Coreutils. So scripts written for a system that
uses GNU Coreutils may require modification to work with BusyBox.
