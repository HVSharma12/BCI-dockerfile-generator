# The Valkey {{ image.tag_version }} container image

{% include 'badges.j2' %}

## Description

Valkey is a high-performance data structure server that primarily serves
key/value workloads. It supports a wide range of native structures and
an extensible plugin system for adding new data structures and access
patterns.

## How to use the image

The image ships with the valkey server and a persistent storage configured
to `/data`.

To start an instance, follow these instructions:


```ShellSession
podman run --rm {{ image.pretty_reference }}
```

In case you want start with persistent storage, run this:

```ShellSession
podman run --rm {{ image.pretty_reference }} valkey-server --save 60 1
```

This one will save a snapshot of the DB every 60 seconds if at least 1
write operation was performed. If persistence is enabled, data is stored
in the VOLUME /data, which can be used with `-v /host/dir:/data`.
