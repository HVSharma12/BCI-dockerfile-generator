# The PHP FPM {{ image.tag_version }} container image

{% include 'badges.j2' %}

{% include 'php_description.j2' %}

## How to use the image

The image contains [PHP-FPM](https://php-fpm.org/), a FastCGI implementation
for PHP that serves content via the FastCGI protocol and not via HTTP(S). This
requires a reverse proxy that can handle FastCGI and can serve content via
HTTP(s).

**Caution:** FastCGI does not offer any protection or access control, so the
open socket must be protected via network separation. This means that the
PHP-FPM container must run in a separate private network or a pod, and its
socket must be exposed to the reverse proxy only.

To deploy an application in the PHP-FPM container, copy the application into
`/srv/www/htdocs` (this directory is the `WORKDIR` of the container image):

```Dockerfile
FROM {{ image.pretty_reference }}

RUN set -eux; \
    zypper -n in $my_dependencies; \
    # additional setup steps

# Copy the app into the PHP-FPM document root
COPY app/ .
```

To configure NGINX as a reverse proxy, add the following to the
`server` section in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:
```
        location ~ \.php$ {
           include                   fastcgi_params;
           fastcgi_index             index.php;
           root           /srv/www/htdocs/;
           fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9000;
           fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        }
```

Additionally, create `/etc/nginx/fastcgi_params` with the following contents:
```
fastcgi_param  QUERY_STRING       $query_string;
fastcgi_param  REQUEST_METHOD     $request_method;
fastcgi_param  CONTENT_TYPE       $content_type;
fastcgi_param  CONTENT_LENGTH     $content_length;

fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_NAME        $fastcgi_script_name;
fastcgi_param  REQUEST_URI        $request_uri;
fastcgi_param  DOCUMENT_URI       $document_uri;
fastcgi_param  DOCUMENT_ROOT      $document_root;
fastcgi_param  SERVER_PROTOCOL    $server_protocol;
fastcgi_param  REQUEST_SCHEME     $scheme;
fastcgi_param  HTTPS              $https if_not_empty;

fastcgi_param  GATEWAY_INTERFACE  CGI/1.1;
fastcgi_param  SERVER_SOFTWARE    nginx/$nginx_version;

fastcgi_param  REMOTE_ADDR        $remote_addr;
fastcgi_param  REMOTE_PORT        $remote_port;
fastcgi_param  SERVER_ADDR        $server_addr;
fastcgi_param  SERVER_PORT        $server_port;
fastcgi_param  SERVER_NAME        $server_name;

# PHP only, required if PHP was built with --enable-force-cgi-redirect
fastcgi_param  REDIRECT_STATUS    200;
```

If you are using a NGINX container with the above changes, you can
use a Podman pod to deploy the application:
```ShellSession
$ podman pod create --name fpm -p 80:8080
$ podman run -d --pod fpm name-of-my-fpm-container
$ podman run -d --pod fpm name-of-my-nginx-container
```

The website is served on port 8080, and the FastCGI application is not
accessible from outside of the `fpm` pod.
