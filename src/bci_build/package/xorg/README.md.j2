## Description

X.Org Server is the free and open-source implementation of the X Window System
(X11) display server stewarded by the X.Org Foundation.


## Usage

This container image is intended for consumption via a helm chart which launches
the container in the intended fashion.

To launch the container manually, switch to a tty and execute the following
command as `root`:

```ShellSession
# podman run \
      --privileged -d \
      -e XAUTHORITY=/home/user/xauthority/.xauth \
      -v xauthority:/home/user/xauthority:rw \
      -v xsocket:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw \
      -v /run/udev/data:/run/udev/data:rw \
      --security-opt=no-new-privileges \
      {{ image.pretty_reference }}
```

The volumes are optional and can be omitted if you wish to only start X. The
volumes are necessary to launch additional graphical applications using the
containerized Xorg container.
