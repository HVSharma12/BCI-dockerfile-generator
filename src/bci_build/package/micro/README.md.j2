# {{ image.title }}: Suitable for deploying static binaries
{% include 'badges.j2' %}

## Description
The `bci-micro` image is smaller than `bci-minimal` because it
does not include the RPM package manager, only the RPM database.

The primary use case for the image is deploying static binaries produced
externally or during multi-stage builds.


## Usage

As there is no straightforward way to install additional
dependencies inside the container image, we recommend deploying a project
using the `bci-micro` image only when the final build artifact bundles all
dependencies needs no further installation of packaged requirements.

Example using a Go application:

```Dockerfile
FROM registry.suse.com/bci/golang:stable as build

WORKDIR /app

RUN go install github.com/go-training/helloworld@latest

# Create image to bundle app
FROM registry.suse.com/bci/bci-micro:15.6

COPY --from=build /go/bin/helloworld /usr/local/bin/helloworld

CMD ["/usr/local/bin/helloworld"]
```


{% include 'licensing_and_eula.j2' %}
